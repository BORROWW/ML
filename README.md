Introduction:
This repository contains my learning journey in Machine Learning (ML) from scratch. It includes a collection of projects, examples, and concepts that I have learned throughout my ML journey.

Motivation:
The purpose of creating this repository is to document my ML learning process and to share my knowledge with others who are interested in learning ML. Additionally, it serves as a reference for myself to revisit and review the concepts I have learned.

Structure:
The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a specific project or topic related to ML. Each folder contains a README file that provides an overview of the project or topic and how it relates to ML.

Projects:
The projects in this repository cover a wide range of applications of ML such as classification, regression, clustering, and deep learning. Some of the projects include sentiment analysis, image classification, stock price prediction, and recommendation systems. Each project includes a detailed description of the problem statement, data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Concepts:
In addition to the projects, this repository also includes a collection of notebooks covering different ML concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics. These notebooks provide a theoretical foundation for the projects and serve as a reference for understanding the underlying concepts.

Conclusion:
I hope this repository helps beginners to get started with ML and provides a valuable resource for those who are already familiar with the topic. Feel free to contribute to the repository and provide feedback or suggestions. Happy learning!
